# Mitigating-Churn-Risks-in-PowerCo

The project aims to analyze customer churn in a utility company using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical customer data, including consumption patterns, contract details, and demographic information, the project seeks to identify factors contributing to churn and develop predictive models to forecast customer churn. By understanding the drivers of churn and predicting future churn events, the company can proactively implement targeted retention strategies to mitigate customer attrition and improve customer satisfaction. Through this data-driven approach, the project aims to optimize customer retention efforts and enhance the long-term sustainability and profitability of the utility company.
